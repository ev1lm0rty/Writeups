# Server Side Request Forgery
```
Server-side request forgery (also known as SSRF) is a web security vulnerability that allows an attacker to 
induce the server-side application to make HTTP requests to an arbitrary domain of the attacker's choosing.
In typical SSRF examples, the attacker might cause the server to make a connection back to itself, or to 
other web-based services within the organization's infrastructure, or to external third-party systems.
